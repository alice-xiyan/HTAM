# Sustainable By Design chapter 6
This short chapter gives us an inspiring insight on why products should be designed and manufactured. It redefined the notion of beauty, which focuses on the inner meaning than external appearance. More importantly, it points out that design is a key component in creating a creative re-engagement with ‘things’. It then makes me come to rethink of our designers' responsibilities in building a sustainable world.

## Notes 
```
" Design can be a key component in this; how we design products, the assumptions we make and the preconceptions we
have when we design, as well as our notions of good design, all have to be questioned. "
```
```
" When we consider home making and meal preparation, we place greater emphasis on the intentions, the effort and the
meanings behind the decisions and actions, rather than focusing solely on the end result. "
```
```
" Hence, its value is inherent rather than instrumental, and its beauty is intrinsic rather than extrinsic. "
```
```
" Hence, these types of products are a major area of concern and must be reconsidered and re-conceived if we are to
seriously address sustainability within the field of product design. "
```
```
" a fundamental and irreconcilable disparity between our conventional notions of beauty – what might be termed ‘outer’
or extrinsic beauty, and sustainability. "
```
```
" Similarly, the beauty of the ‘local’ product lies in what it means, what it represents and what it aims for, rather
than simply in its outer appearance as a physical object. "
```
```
" Beauty can be captured in the object through what it represents, and not simply through its appearance. "
```
```
" If, in its design and manufacture, the associated environmental, ethical and socio-economic issues are ignored,
then the object can become symbolic not of beauty but of ugliness and harm. "
