# First attempt at 3D scanning
My first attempt at 3D scanning is using the 3D Scanner App on ipad to capture various everyday objects, such as a **candle**, an **orange**, **bamboo**, **tissue paper**, and **an IKEA wooden horse**. Although I‘ve tried many times, I found it quite challenging to fully capture all the fine details of these items. The scan results always end up warped or distorted because of hand movement or camera shake.

After the scanning, I searched for how to improve the results:  
1. ​​Stabilize Everything:​​ Use a tripod for your iPad to eliminate shake.
2. Control Lighting:​​ Scan in even, shadow-free light to avoid noise.
3. ​​Prep Surfaces:​​ Dust matte spray on shiny objects to reduce glare.
4. Overlap Scans:​​ Move slowly around the object, ensuring each new scan overlaps the previous one by 70-80%.
5. Post-Process:​​ Use software to clean up the mesh and fill small holes after scanning.
