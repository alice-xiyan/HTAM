# How I make 'THE QUEEN'S KNIGHT‘
## 01 | My Inspiration ##
When I finished scanning my pony ornament, I imported the resulting file into **Blender** to try to retopology and model it, but since the results from the 3D scan were not satisfactory, I only used the approximate shape of the horse's head as **a modeling reference**.  

Then, I recalled that I was learning chess on **Duolingo** software recently, there is a chess piece called **'knight'**, which happens to be the shape of a horse's head.

The role of knight chess is as the name suggests, protecting the king and queen, the move is L-shaped, and can often set up unexpected attacks, which I thought was interesting, so I decided to model and print a knight piece.  

## 02 | Modeling process ##
First, I made the base⬇️:

Next, I made a rough horse head⬇️:

I added ears and more details, and it is its final look⬇️:

## 03 | 3D printing process ##
I use the 'UltiMaker Cura' software to slice it and than printed it out by using the samll printer in Fablab⬇️:

## 04 | Reflection ##
I think the overall printing effect is good, but there are still **some obvious mistakes**:   
1. The angle of the horse's mouth and ears is too large, there is **no support**, and there is adhesion with the body
2. At the bottom there is **a circle of plastic for fastening**, which is difficult to remove from the part

Next time when I print this chess, I can print it** from another angl**e to prevent the supportion problem (for example, maybe let the chess to lay down). Also, I can print **a larger size** so it can fix to the printing borad without extra fastening plastic at the bottom.
