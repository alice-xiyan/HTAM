# 0929｜A Kerf Testing
In this class, we learned how to do leaser cutting and what is a kerf testing. We also made a kerf tesing board ourselves.  
## Step1: Drawing the lines
First, measure the original size of the board with a vernier caliper. It's about 3.9mm⬇️.

We then used Adobe Illusatrater to draw, here we need to pay attention to the difference between computer size and actual size. We drew 12 sizes from 3.15mm to 4.25mm with a difference of 0.05mm.

## Step2: Leaser cutting
After drawing the lines in AI, we need to export the document and import it into the leaser cutting software. In that software, it's very important to set up the correct color of each lines, which would determine the cutting speed and strength. When preparation is down, it's time to cut!

## Step3: Testing
Finally, we get two well-cut kerf testing board:

And now is the exciting test time:

The wooden board was stuck firmly at the position of 3.6 mm, and the actual size of the wooden board was 3.9 mm, which meant that the laser cutting had caused 0.3 mm damage, and if this laser cutting machine is used for fine cutting operations in the future, we need to take this into account.
