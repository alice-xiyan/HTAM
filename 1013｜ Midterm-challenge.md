# 'Energy regulator' —— the Outer Box of A Future Product based on Arduino
The content will bes divided into 4 chapters:  
-  01 How it looks like?
-  02 Why I made this?
-  03 How it works?
-  04 What did I do?  

## 01 How it looks like?  
 - My product is mainly composed of five parts: PLA box, acrylic board, spring, hinge, and an Arduino and screen holder⬇️:

 - When they are fully assembled, they look like this⬇️:   
**MISS PIC**

## 02 Why I made this?  
 - Because I imagined a future where technology develops at an incredible pace to the point where **the flow of energy is almost imperceptible**. I hope that this product will **visualize energy**, **reminding people** that technology is not magic that appears out of thin air, but rather truly consumes energy such as **electricity, water, and fossil fuels on Earth**.


## 03 How it works?  
 - You can put the arduino board and the screen (I used apple watch as an example) fixed to **the holder board**.
 - **Springs and hinges** on the box allow you to open and close the box tightly at will. At the same time, since the bottom is flat, you can use it upright on the tabletop. You can also attach a magnetic sticker to the flat back of the box and attach it wherever you want.
 - Transparent panels made of **acrylic** allow you to observe real-time changes in the data on the screen while also providing protection.

## 04 What did I do?  
 - Here are my technical files⬇️:
   1. 3d model of [**the pla box**](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/arduino_box.stl) and [**the spring**](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/spring.3mf)
   2. Leaser cutting file of [**the acrylic board**](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/leaser%20cutting.svg)
   3. 3d model of [**the Arduino and screen holder**](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/holder.3mf)
