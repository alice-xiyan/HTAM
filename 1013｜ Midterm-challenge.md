## 02 Why I made this?  
 - Because I imagined a future where technology develops at an incredible pace to the point where **the flow of energy is almost imperceptible**. I hope that this product will **visualize energy**, **reminding people** that technology is not magic that appears out of thin air, but rather truly consumes energy such as **electricity, water, and fossil fuels on Earth**.
