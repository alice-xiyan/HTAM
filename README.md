 1. Lecture introducing Fab Labs, personal digital fabrication, sustainable by design, and open-source hardware.  
 2. Explanation of documentation practices using GitHub in a “journal style.”  
 3. Hands-on activity: each pair of students will perform a 3D scan of an everyday object.  
 4. Deliverables: read a selected book chapter, open a GitHub repository, and publish the first journal entry with scans, photos, and reflections.

  <summary>What did I do after class</summary>
 
 1. I read the [Sustainable By Design chapter 6](https://pages.github.com/(https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0916%EF%BD%9CSustainable%20By%20Design%20chapter%206.pdf)) and wrote some [notes](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0916%EF%BD%9CReading%20notes.md).  
 2. I signed up for a Github account and posted my first file by learning [official guidance](https://docs.github.com/zh/get-started) (really helpful and easy to understand)  
 3. [0921｜First First attempt at 3D scanning](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0921%EF%BD%9CFirst%20First%20attempt%20at%203D%20scanning)
