# HTAM
Here are my assignments and thoughts at the HTAM class. 

## Week 1 - Introduction and First Exploration
<details>
  <summary>Class Schedule</summary>
  
 1. Lecture introducing Fab Labs, personal digital fabrication, sustainable by design, and open-source hardware.  
 2. Explanation of documentation practices using GitHub in a “journal style.”  
 3. Hands-on activity: each pair of students will perform a 3D scan of an everyday object.  
 4. Deliverables: read a selected book chapter, open a GitHub repository, and publish the first journal entry with scans, photos, and reflections.

  <summary>What did I do after class</summary>
 
 1. I read the [Sustainable By Design chapter 6](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0916%EF%BD%9CSustainable%20By%20Design%20chapter%206.pdf).    
 2. I signed up for a Github account and posted my first file by learning [official guidance](https://docs.github.com/zh/get-started) (really helpful and easy to understand)  
 3. [0921｜First First attempt at 3D scanning](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0921%EF%BD%9CFirst%20First%20attempt%20at%203D%20scanning.md)

## Week 2 - 3D Printing
<details>
  <summary>Class Schedule</summary>

1. Lecture on additive manufacturing theory, including materials, strengths and limitations.  
2. Practice session: calibration tests and printing of small models to understand the basics of the machines.  
3. Extension of the scanned object: process the 3D scan and create a remix for 3D printing.

  <summary>What did I do after class</summary>

  1. Process the 3D scan result and export it as a printable file, i named it as ['THE QUEEN'S KNIGHT'](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0923%EF%BD%9CHow%20I%20make%20'THE%20QUEEN'S%20KNIGHT'.md)
  2. Using small 3D printer to print it out and here's [the document](https://github.com/alice-xiyan/HTAM/blob/main/0923%EF%BD%9CHow%20I%20make%20'THE%20QUEEN'S%20KNIGHT'.md).

## Week 3 - Laser Cutting and Mechanical Design
<details>
  <summary>Class Schedule</summary>

1. Lecture on subtractive manufacturing with a focus on laser cutting, materials, and joint techniques.
2. Demonstration and guided practice with the laser cutter.
3. Design and cut a small mechanical structure (e.g., living hinge, joints) to explore assembly principles.

## Week 7 - Consolidation and Public Engagement
<details>
  <summary>Class Schedule</summary>

1. Groups work on refining prototypes and preparing visual communication materials.
2. Preparation of exhibition materials such as posters, visuals, or short videos.
3. Participation in Maker Faire during the weekend, where students will present their projects and engage with the public.
4. Deliverables: working prototype or mockup, A3 poster and visual materials, updated documentation, and exhibition-ready projects to bring to Maker Faire.
